I would do anything just to be with you and see you grow and see you smle and laugh. You being sad because of me is the worst thing I would ever want. It makes me regret so much. Fighting with you - can't even imagine that and I never wanna do that babe. Let's go on more drives, more beach dates, more walks, more random plans, more sneak ins, more food dates, make more love, cuddle more, hug more, more grocery shopping, watch more movies, cook more food and I can just keep going on. Sometimes maybe idhar udhar kisika koi expectations ho jo dusra banda na pohoch paaye but ye toh hota rahega na devi. I don't want things like these to cause upsets between us I just hate hate haaateeee myself when you're upset with me. Just want us to be like the photo above <3 <3 <3. I love you with all my heart Devika and you have been the best girlfriend, much more than what I had imagined and expected.</h5>
